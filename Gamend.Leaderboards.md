# `Gamend.Leaderboards`
[🔗](https://github.com/appsinacup/gamend/blob/v1.0.7/lib/gamend/leaderboards.ex#L1)

The Leaderboards context.

Provides server-authoritative leaderboard management. Scores can only be
submitted via server-side code — there is no public API for score submission.

## Usage

    # Create a leaderboard
    {:ok, lb} = Leaderboards.create_leaderboard(%{
      slug: "weekly_kills",
      title: "Weekly Kills",
      sort_order: :desc,
      operator: :incr
    })

    # Submit score (server-only): resolve the active leaderboard first and submit by ID
    leaderboard = Leaderboards.get_active_leaderboard_by_slug("weekly_kills")
    {:ok, record} = Leaderboards.submit_score(leaderboard.id, user_id, 10)

    # List records with rank (use leaderboard id)
    records = Leaderboards.list_records(leaderboard.id, page: 1, limit: 25)

## Keys

A board can hold several rankings: a record is unique per user (or label)
and `key`, and every read ranks within one key. `""` is the default, a
board with one ranking. A host keeping, say, a best per game and language
on one board submits with `key: "match|60|es_es"` and metadata naming the
parts; `list_records/2` with `key: :all` and `meta:` reads across keys
(`best_per_user: true` keeps each player's best of them). `list_keys/2`
names the keys a board holds, and `list_records_above/3` the records just
ahead of a score on one key. A board can show its keys as tabs and
filters on `/leaderboards` (`GamendWeb.LeaderboardViews`).

## All time

A `:best` board with seasons (`all_time?/1`: a start or an end date) has
an all-time ranking too: every season of its slug read as one, each
player's (or label's) best row of them, ranked. `all_time: true` on
`list_records/2`, `count_records/2`, `get_user_record/3` and
`list_keys/2` reads it, per key, from any season of the slug.

Those rows are kept on a hidden board of their own, `<slug>__all_time`:
a submit to a season raises it the way a `:best` submit does, an edited
or deleted season row reads its owner's best again, and a deleted season
refills it. So All time reads like any board, indexed and cached, however
many seasons and players there are. Computing it from the seasons on
every read took a second a page at 100,000 rows. The board is made and
filled the first time it is asked for; `rebuild_all_time/1` refills it
for rows written around `submit_score/5`.

## Hidden boards

`hidden: true` keeps a board out of `list_leaderboards/1`,
`list_leaderboard_groups/1` and their counts unless `include_hidden: true`
is passed. Everything else reads it like any board.

## Guests

When the host requires an account to be listed (`Gamend.AccountRequired`,
`:leaderboards`), a guest's records stay on a public board but out of every
read of it: lists, counts and ranks, so a guest moves nobody. The guest's
own `get_user_record/3` still answers, ranked where it would stand, with
`hidden: true`. A hidden board keeps its guests (it is no one's public
board), and `guests: true` reads them anyway (the admin's view).

Whether a record is a guest's is stored on it (`Record`'s `guest`), kept
by the database: set from the user on insert, moved when the user
registers (or loses their last identity). A listed read filters the
record alone, on its own rank index (`NOT guest`); joining every record to
its user took a second a rank at a million rows.

    # Get user's record (use leaderboard id)
    {:ok, record} = Leaderboards.get_user_record(leaderboard.id, user_id)

# `all_time?`

```elixir
@spec all_time?(Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()) :: boolean()
```

Whether a board has an all-time ranking: a `:best` board with seasons (a
start or an end date). *All time* above.

# `change_leaderboard`

```elixir
@spec change_leaderboard(Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t(), map()) ::
  Ecto.Changeset.t()
```

Returns a changeset for a leaderboard (used in forms).

# `change_record`

```elixir
@spec change_record(Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t(), map()) :: Ecto.Changeset.t()

@spec count_all_records() :: non_neg_integer()
```

Count all leaderboard records across all leaderboards.

# `count_leaderboard_groups`

# `count_records`

```elixir
@spec count_records(Ecto.UUID.t(), keyword()) :: non_neg_integer()
```

Counts records for a leaderboard: the same `:key`, `:meta`,
`:best_per_user`, `:search` and `:all_time` as `list_records/2`.

# `count_records_by_board`

```elixir
@spec count_records_by_board([Ecto.UUID.t()]) :: %{
  required(Ecto.UUID.t()) =&gt; non_neg_integer()
}
```

How many records each of `leaderboard_ids` holds, every key and every
player (the admin's view), in one grouped query: `%{id => count}`, a board
without records absent.

# `create_leaderboard`

```elixir
@spec create_leaderboard(Gamend.Types.leaderboard_create_attrs()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()} | {:error, Ecto.Changeset.t()}
```

Creates a new leaderboard.

## Attributes

See `t:Gamend.Types.leaderboard_create_attrs/0` for available fields.

## Examples

    iex> create_leaderboard(%{slug: "my_lb", title: "My Leaderboard"})
    {:ok, %Leaderboard{}}

    iex> create_leaderboard(%{slug: "", title: ""})
    {:error, %Ecto.Changeset{}}

```elixir
@spec delete_leaderboard(Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()} | {:error, Ecto.Changeset.t()}
```

Deletes a leaderboard and all its records.

# `delete_record`

```elixir
@spec delete_record(Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()} | {:error, Ecto.Changeset.t()}
```

Deletes a record.

# `delete_user_record`

@spec delete_user_record(String.t(), Ecto.UUID.t(), keyword()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()} | {:error, :not_found}
```

Deletes a user's record from a leaderboard (in `key:`, default `""`).
Accepts either leaderboard ID or slug (both strings).

# `end_leaderboard`

```elixir
@spec end_leaderboard(Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t() | String.t()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()}
  | {:error, Ecto.Changeset.t() | :not_found}
```

Ends a leaderboard by setting `ends_at` to the current time.

# `get_active_leaderboard_by_slug`

```elixir
@spec get_active_leaderboard_by_slug(String.t()) ::
  Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t() | nil
```

Gets the currently active leaderboard with the given slug.
Returns `nil` if no active leaderboard exists.

An active leaderboard is one that:
- Has not ended (`ends_at` is nil or in the future)
- Has started (`starts_at` is nil or in the past)

If multiple active leaderboards exist with the same slug,
returns the most recently created one.

# `get_label_record`

```elixir
@spec get_label_record(Ecto.UUID.t(), String.t(), String.t()) ::
  Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t() | nil
```

Gets a single record by leaderboard ID, label and key (default `""`).

# `get_leaderboard`

```elixir
@spec get_leaderboard(String.t()) :: Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t() | nil
```

Gets a leaderboard by its UUID, or the active leaderboard by slug.

## Examples

    iex> get_leaderboard("0198c0de-...")
    %Leaderboard{}

    iex> get_leaderboard(Ecto.UUID.generate())
    nil

# `get_leaderboard!`

```elixir
@spec get_leaderboard!(String.t()) :: Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()
```

Gets a leaderboard by its ID. Raises if not found.

# `get_record`

```elixir
@spec get_record(Ecto.UUID.t()) :: Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t() | nil
```

Gets a record by its ID, or `nil` when there is none (or `id` is not a UUID).

Intended for internal/admin usage.

# `get_record`

```elixir
@spec get_record(Ecto.UUID.t(), Ecto.UUID.t(), String.t()) ::
  Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t() | nil
```

Gets a single record by leaderboard ID, user ID and key (default `""`).

# `get_record!`

```elixir
@spec get_record!(Ecto.UUID.t()) :: Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()
```

Like `get_record/1`, but raises `Ecto.NoResultsError` when there is none.

# `get_user_record`

```elixir
@spec get_user_record(Ecto.UUID.t(), Ecto.UUID.t(), keyword()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()} | {:error, :not_found}
```

Gets a user's record with their rank (within its key: `key:`, default `""`).
Returns `{:ok, record_with_rank}` or `{:error, :not_found}`.

`all_time: true` answers their best row of every season, ranked all time
(*All time* above).

# `host_action`

```elixir
@spec host_action(String.t(), Ecto.UUID.t() | nil) :: {String.t(), String.t()} | nil
```

Where a board is climbed, for the button on its page and its card:
`{label, path}`, or nil. Set `config :gamend_core, :leaderboard_action,
{Module, :function}`; it is called as `function(user_id | nil, slug)` and
answers `{label, path}` (the label already in the reader's language) or nil.

A board only says what it counts ("Most kilometers sailed"), never where
that is done, and only the host knows its own pages, as with a quest
(`Gamend.Quests.host_action/2`). A path starts with one `/` (`"/games"`); a
URL or `"//…"` is dropped. The page keeps the reader's locale prefix on it.

# `invalidate_cache`

```elixir
@spec invalidate_cache() :: :ok
```

Forget the cached leaderboard lookups.

Every write in here does this already. It is public because a CALLER can also
learn the cache is stale: `get_active_leaderboard_by_slug/1` is cached for a
minute, so a board deleted (or rolled back, under a test sandbox) hands out an
id whose row is gone, and the next `submit_score/4` fails on the foreign key.
A caller that sees that can drop the lookup and try again rather than wait out
the TTL.

# `list_keys`

```elixir
@spec list_keys(String.t(), keyword()) :: [String.t()]
```

The keys a board holds, sorted, from its listed records; with `prefix:`
only the keys starting with it (`"match|"`: every language Word match has
runs in). A key only guests have played is not offered. `all_time: true`
names the keys of every season of the slug (*All time* above).

# `list_leaderboard_groups`

```elixir
@spec list_leaderboard_groups(keyword()) :: [map()]
```

Lists unique leaderboard slugs with summary info.

Returns a list of maps with:
- `:slug` - the leaderboard slug
- `:title` - title from the latest leaderboard
- `:description` - description from the latest leaderboard
- `:active_id` - ID of the currently active leaderboard (or nil)
- `:latest_id` - ID of the most recent leaderboard
- `:season_count` - total number of leaderboards with this slug

# `list_leaderboards`

```elixir
@spec list_leaderboards(keyword()) :: [Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()]
```

Lists leaderboards with optional filters.

## Options

  * `:slug` - Filter by slug (returns all seasons of that leaderboard)
  * `:active` - If `true`, only active leaderboards. If `false`, only ended.
  * `:order_by` - Order by field: `:ends_at` or `:inserted_at` (default)
  * `:starts_after` - Only leaderboards that started after this DateTime
  * `:starts_before` - Only leaderboards that started before this DateTime
  * `:ends_after` - Only leaderboards that end after this DateTime
  * `:ends_before` - Only leaderboards that end before this DateTime
  * `:include_hidden` - Also hidden boards (default false)
  * `:page` - Page number (default 1)
  * `:page_size` - Page size (default 25)

## Examples

    iex> list_leaderboards(active: true)
    [%Leaderboard{}, ...]

    iex> list_leaderboards(slug: "weekly_kills")
    [%Leaderboard{}, ...]

    iex> list_leaderboards(starts_after: ~U[2025-01-01 00:00:00Z])
    [%Leaderboard{}, ...]

# `list_leaderboards_by_slug`

```elixir
@spec list_leaderboards_by_slug(String.t(), keyword()) :: [
  Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()
]
```

Lists all leaderboards with the given slug (all seasons), ordered by end date.

# `list_records`

```elixir
@spec list_records(String.t(), keyword()) :: [Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()]
```

Lists records for a leaderboard, ordered by rank.

## Options

See `t:Gamend.Types.pagination_opts/0` for available options, plus:

  * `:key` — the ranking to read (default `""`), or `:all` for every key's
    rows ranked together.
  * `:meta` — a map, keeping only records whose `metadata[field]` equals
    each value (`%{"game" => "match", "lang" => "es_es"}`). Ranks are
    computed **within** the filtered set, because "the Spanish board" means
    first among Spanish, not 57th overall. That is the opposite of
    `:search`, which ranks over the whole key so a found player's real
    position is what shows.
  * `:best_per_user` — with `key: :all`, each player's (or label's) best
    row only: one board read across keys, a player once.
  * `:guests` — `true` lists guests' records on a public board too, when
    the host keeps them off it (`Gamend.AccountRequired`): the admin's view.
  * `:all_time` — `true` reads every season of the board's slug as one
    ranking (*All time* above), with `:key` and `:search` only. A board
    without seasons reads as itself.

# `list_records_above`

```elixir
@spec list_records_above(String.t(), integer(), keyword()) :: [
  Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()
]
```

The listed records just ahead of `score` on one key, nearest first: the
runs a player at that score would overtake next. Ahead means a strictly
better score (higher on a `:desc` board, lower on an `:asc` one), so a tie
is not ahead. Each record carries its `rank`.

It needs no record of the caller's: a first-timer reads it with their
first score, and a guest with theirs, though a guest's own record is not
listed (`Gamend.AccountRequired`). `list_records_around_user/3` needs the
caller on the board. Labels' records are listed, like any.

## Options

  * `:key` — the ranking (default `""`)
  * `:limit` — how many (default 3)

# `list_records_around_user`

```elixir
@spec list_records_around_user(String.t(), Ecto.UUID.t(), keyword()) :: [
  Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()
]
```

Lists records around a specific user (centered on their position).

Returns records above and below the user's rank.

## Options

  * `:limit` - Total number of records to return (default 11, centered on user)
  * `:key` - The ranking (default `""`)

# `list_records_beside`

```elixir
@spec list_records_beside(String.t(), Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t(), keyword()) ::
  {[Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()], [Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()]}
```

The listed records either side of `record` on its key: `{above, below}`,
each nearest first, each carrying its rank. Above is sorting ahead of it
the way ranks count (a better score, or the same one set earlier), below
sorting behind it, so the ranks run on from the record's own: `rank - 1`,
`rank - 2`… above, `rank + 1`… below. `record` must carry its rank
(`get_user_record/3`'s).

A record kept off the board (a guest's, `Gamend.AccountRequired`) reads
the same: its rank is where it would stand, and the rows behind it are
numbered as if it stood there. Read off the rank index, as
`list_records_above/3` is: the key is never ranked whole.

## Options

  * `:above`, `:below` — how many on each side (default 1)

# `list_records_last`

```elixir
@spec list_records_last(String.t(), keyword()) :: [Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()]
```

The last records listed on a key, in rank order, each carrying its rank:
the bottom of the board, where a player with no score yet comes in.

## Options

  * `:key` — the ranking (default `""`)
  * `:limit` — how many (default 3)

# `merge_user_records`

```elixir
@spec merge_user_records(Ecto.UUID.t(), Ecto.UUID.t()) :: non_neg_integer()
```

Moves `from_user_id`'s records onto `to_user_id`, the way a guest's play
joins the account they log in to (`Gamend.Accounts.GuestMerge`). The
account's records are never lowered or deleted, and no hook or quest event
fires: these scores were submitted once already.

  * `best` boards keep the better of the two (the board's sort order).
  * `incr` boards add the two up.
  * `set` and `decr` boards take the guest's record only where the account
    has none on that board and key.

A guest's records left behind go with the guest account. Answers how many
records reached the account.

# `rebuild_all_time`

```elixir
@spec rebuild_all_time(String.t()) :: {:ok, non_neg_integer()} | :error
```

Fills the all-time board of `slug`'s seasons again from them (*All time*
above). Reads make and fill it on their own the first time; this is for
rows written around `submit_score/5`, such as a bulk import or
`mix demo.seed`. Answers how many rows it holds, or `:error` when no board
under `slug` has an all-time ranking.

# `resolve_slugs`

```elixir
@spec resolve_slugs([String.t()]) :: %{
  required(String.t()) =&gt; Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()
}
```

Resolves multiple slugs to their currently active leaderboards in a single query.

Returns a map of `slug => %Leaderboard{}` for each slug that has an active
leaderboard. Slugs with no active leaderboard are omitted from the result.

## Examples

    iex> resolve_slugs(["weekly_kills", "monthly_score", "nonexistent"])
    %{
      "weekly_kills" => %Leaderboard{id: 1, slug: "weekly_kills", ...},
      "monthly_score" => %Leaderboard{id: 5, slug: "monthly_score", ...}
    }

# `submit_label_score`

```elixir
@spec submit_label_score(String.t(), String.t(), integer(), map(), keyword()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()} | {:error, term()}
```

Submit a score for a label-based (non-user) record.

Works just like `submit_score/4` but uses a string label instead of a user ID.
This is useful for statistics, rankings by category, etc.

## Examples

    iex> submit_label_score(leaderboard_id, "English", 42)
    {:ok, %Record{label: "English", score: 42}}

# `submit_score`

```elixir
@spec submit_score(String.t(), Ecto.UUID.t(), integer(), map(), keyword()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()} | {:error, term()}
```

Submits a score for a user on a leaderboard.

This is a server-only function — there is no public API for score submission.
The score is processed according to the leaderboard's operator:

  * `:set` — Always replace with new score
  * `:best` — Only update if new score is better (respects sort_order)
  * `:incr` — Add to existing score
  * `:decr` — Subtract from existing score

To submit to a leaderboard by slug, first get the active leaderboard ID:

    leaderboard = Leaderboards.get_active_leaderboard_by_slug("weekly_kills")
    Leaderboards.submit_score(leaderboard.id, user_id, 10)

## Examples

    iex> submit_score(123, user_id, 10)
    {:ok, %Record{score: 10}}

    iex> submit_score(123, user_id, 5, %{weapon: "sword"})
    {:ok, %Record{score: 15, metadata: %{weapon: "sword"}}}

`key:` (default `""`) is the ranking within the board the score goes to;
the operator applies per key.

    iex> submit_score(123, user_id, 23, %{"game" => "match"}, key: "match|60")
    {:ok, %Record{key: "match|60", score: 23}}

# `update_leaderboard`

```elixir
@spec update_leaderboard(
  Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t(),
  Gamend.Types.leaderboard_update_attrs()
) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Leaderboard.t()} | {:error, Ecto.Changeset.t()}
```

Updates an existing leaderboard.

Note: `slug`, `sort_order`, and `operator` cannot be changed after creation.

## Attributes

See `t:Gamend.Types.leaderboard_update_attrs/0` for available fields.

# `update_record`

```elixir
@spec update_record(Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t(), map()) ::
  {:ok, Gamend.Leaderboards.Record.t()} | {:error, Ecto.Changeset.t()}
```

Updates an existing record.

Intended for internal/admin usage.
